It contains sample requests for a series of tests that validate different aspects of an API, including:\n\n1. **Status code verification:** We'll check if the API returns the expected status codes for various requests, ensuring reliability and proper error handling.\n2. **JSON schema verification:** We'll make sure the JSON response conforms to a specified JSON Schema, ensuring API contracts are honored.\n3. **Response time verification:** We'll verify that the API's response time is within the acceptable range, providing a smooth user experience and optimizing performance.\n4. **Response body verification:** We'll validate the structure and content of the response body for accuracy, ensuring the integrity of the data and preventing potential issues downstream.\n5. **Header verification:** We'll confirm the presence and correct values of specific headers in the response, enabling secure and well-structured communication between your app and its users.\n    \n\n## **Using this collection**\n\n**Step 1:** Send the sample requests and view the response and test results.\n\n**Step 2:** Replace the sample request URLs with your desired API endpoints.\n\n**Step 3:** Customize the tests in the \"Tests\" tab if needed. Don't forget to save your changes.\n\n**Step 4:** Run the collection by selecting \"Run\".\n\n### Resources\n\n[Scripting in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/intro-to-scripts/)\n\n[Test script examples](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/test-examples/)\n\n[Postman Sandbox API reference](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/grpc/postman-sandbox-api/#writing-assertions)\n\n[Using the Collection Runner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/)",
